        <article>E-Portfolio<br><br>
          In school, we had to make a E-Portfolio. This is a file, where I had to write texts about different things we did in school. 
          Right now there are 14 sections, each with their own subsections. 
          For example, one of those section is about how to properly structure information gathered trough a presentation or a Website.

        <article>Plane Game<br><br>
          In 9th grade we had to do a Project, which could be anything we wanted to make.
          So I decided to make a 2D game. It's a very simple but fun game where 
          you have to collect coins and avoid the rockets form the right. 
          If your screen is smaller than 1920x1080, you can zoom out with ctrl + scroll.
          You can try the game out at the navigation bar at the top.

        <article>This Website<br><br>
          This website is a project too!
          I built this website on my own with the knowledge I gathered from school.
          We had different requirements for this Website and I completed them all.
          I'll get a mark for this project, so wish me the best of luck.
