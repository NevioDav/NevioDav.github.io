        <article>E-Portfolio<br><br>
          In school, we had to make a E-Portfolio. This is a file, where I had to write texts about different things we did in school. 
          Right now there are 14 sections, each with their own subsections. 
          For example, one of those section is about how to properly structure information gathered trough a presentation or a Website.

        <article>Pizzamodule<br><br>
          The first kind of big thing I did at work was called "Pizzamodule".
          Its build on a website with new features. These features were in all in a seaction of the page.
          The repuirements of the project were, that you can order Pizzas, create new menu items, create new costumers, archive orders and so on.
          Now, I also use this project to test new things out.

        <article>This Website<br><br>
          This website is a project too!
          I built this website on my own with the knowledge I gathered from school.
          We had different requirements for this Website and I completed them all.
          I'll get a mark for this project, so wish me the best of luck.
